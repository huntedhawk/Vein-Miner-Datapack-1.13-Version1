A Vein Miner Datapack, similar to the (popular) mod.

To Install, put the zip-file into your Datapacks Folder which is located in your World Save.

Tools it works with are:

Diamond Pickaxe
Diamond Axe
Diamond Shovel
Diamond Hoe

Iron Pickaxe
Iron Axe
Iron Shovel
Iron Hoe

Shears

To make these tools usable as a veinminer tool, throw them onto an enchanting table and throw an ender eye onto the enchanting table too. This adds the "Vein Miner" Enchantment onto the tool. It's not really an enchantment though, just looks convincingly like it. Only tools with this "enchantment" can vein mine, which makes it way more userfriendly than just sneaking alone, IMO.

To enchant be sure to have Survival Gamemode.

To veinmine Ingame, crouch and mine a block.
Up to 4 Blocks around the block you just mined, the same Blocks get mined too. Or you can use Hoes to turn a larger Area of Dirt into Farmland. Veinmining won't work if you are holding two veinmine-tools, one in your mainhand and in your offhand. A safety measure to accurately target the used tools.

Not every Block is vein-mineable, but there are pver 400 Blocks that do work. Even some that make not a whole lot of sense, like saplings or flowers?

Fortune-, Silk Touch- and Unbreaking-Enchantments work on the veinmined Blocks.

The total amount of blocks mined shows in the durability of the tool, so it's not just one durability lost on the tool but 100 blocks mined.
That also means that if you mine too many Blocks, your Tool might run out of Durability and you end up losing it.
You also get a Hunger Debuff that gets stronger the more the Blocks you mine and when you're too Hungry you can't veinmine.
